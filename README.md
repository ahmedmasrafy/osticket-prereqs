Next, I have to enable Internet Information Services. So I opened control panel and on the left I clicked on "Turn Windows features on or off". Then I scrolled down to IIS and checked the box to enable it.

Next I opened IIS as admin, registered PHP from within IIS, and then finally installed osTicket. I logged into it and practiced dealing with different types of tickets.
